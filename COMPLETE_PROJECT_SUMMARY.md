# ZEBRA ECOSYSTEM – COMPLETE PROJECT (With Security + Cost Control)
## Final Summary: Everything You Need

---

## YOUR SEVEN DOCUMENTS

You now have **7 complete documents** that work together:

### Core Documents (Original)
1. **START_HERE.md** – Executive summary (read first)
2. **ACTION_PLAN_WITH_SECURITY.md** – Step-by-step execution (security-focused)
3. **ZEBRA_COMPLETE_BRIEF.md** – Master architecture reference
4. **SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md** – Data safety framework
5. **SECURITY_INTEGRATION_ROADMAP.md** – How security is built in
6. **DOCUMENT_GUIDE.md** – How all docs connect

### NEW: Cost Management
7. **COST_MANAGEMENT_STRATEGY.md** – Token burn control & cost optimization
8. **ACTION_PLAN_UPDATED_WITH_COSTS.md** – Updated Phase 0 (security + cost)

---

## THE THREE PILLARS OF YOUR ECOSYSTEM

### Pillar 1: Architecture (ZEBRA_COMPLETE_BRIEF.md)
- 3-layer modular design
- Reusable building blocks (zebra_core)
- 4 domain modules
- 2 production CLI apps
- Result: Build once, reuse forever

### Pillar 2: Security (SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md + SECURITY_INTEGRATION_ROADMAP.md)
- 3-zone security model (cloud AI / local Ollama / isolated local)
- Credential management (environment variables, password manager)
- Data separation per domain (homelab, trading, personal, professional)
- Pre-commit hooks (block credential leaks)
- Security checklists (before every cloud AI prompt)
- Result: Your data stays safe, no accidental exposure

### Pillar 3: Cost Control (COST_MANAGEMENT_STRATEGY.md + ACTION_PLAN_UPDATED_WITH_COSTS.md)
- Tool selection by task (Ollama free, Claude Pro $20, ChatGPT Plus $20)
- Cost tracking system (automatic API logging, manual session logging)
- Decision tree (which tool for which task)
- Budget alerts (weekly >$25, monthly >$100)
- Cost attribution (by project, by task type, by tool)
- Result: You know exactly where money goes, never waste expensive tokens

GitHub Copilot:         $0/month  (free if you qualify)
ChatGPT Plus:           $0/month  (optional, skip to save money)
Perplexity Free:        $0/month  (adequate for research)
─────────────────────────────
Total fixed cost:       $20/month
```

### Tool Selection by Task

```
Iteration / debugging / quick coding
  → Ollama (FREE, local, unlimited)

Architecture / design / complex reasoning
  → Claude Pro ($20/mo flat, unlimited)

Second opinion on bugs
  → ChatGPT Plus ($20/mo if you have it; OR ask Ollama again)

Research / API documentation
  → Perplexity Free (5 queries/4hrs, free tier adequate)

Inline code completion
  → GitHub Copilot Free (if you qualify)

Automation / production systems
  → Claude API (only with tracking + rate limiting)
```

### Expected Spend

```
